## Digital FM Modem Pipeline ##

The project implements a hardware-efficient digital modem for Frequency Modulation (FM) targeting the Digilent Arty-Z7 FPGA. 

The demodulator chain is inspired by "A Digital Demodulator for Frequency Modulated Signals" (Yu, 2005), which employs a mixed-demodulator architecture for phase recovery, and CORDIC Vectoring mode algorithm for fast and efficient computation of arctangent.
